Development of an autonomous vehicle prototype in ROS as the capstone project of the mechatronics engineering degree

## Overview
This repository is the ros-package needed for the capstone project for the degree in Mechatronics Engineering in the Tec de Monterrey - Campus Guadalajara.

This project is going to be the platform for several projects about autonomous systems on-campus and will lead to further development in the classes of Robotics and Capstone Project in Mechatronics Engineering.

This packagae has been developed and tested under ROS Kinetic and Ubuntu Xenial 16.04.
